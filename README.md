## What I do these days

Currently, I work at Ksaar, a young start-up involved developing a No-Code / Low-Code application. In a team of 4 devs, I maintain the application, fix bugs and produce features as well. On a day to day basis, I use a lot React and Redux, and Express on Node.js. I am glad to learn bash / zsh scripting and take time on Vim for now.

## What's next ?

I am very interested in Rust and Elixir / Erlang and try to get the most from any shell I use. Should I have more time, I would try to write a web app on Elixir framework Phoenix.

## How I started programming

I worked on E2E testing with Cypress for an operating room management web app called Orgo and developed by Medhop in Paris. I also contributed to move its UI from PHP to Vue 3.

Besides, I attended to the web developer formation at OpenClassroom. In this context, I realized [some projects](####-my-projects-as-a-student) you'll find on my Github profile.

## My student projects

Part of them are deployed through Github Pages or Netlify, the others depend on servers and databases and must be installed before lauching them with Docker Compose.
