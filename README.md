## What I do these days

I work at [Pysae](https://web.pysae.com/), a remote-first company involved in passenger transport management and based in Rennes. As a technical leader focused on backend, I design and develop new features, especially complex ones. What is more, I don't shy away from infrastructure related tasks and occasionnally get my hands dirty in Javascript.

## What's next ?

Motivated by challenges and performance of programms, I'd be glad to work in languages like C, Rust or Go. Like most of us, software developers, I spend some of my spare time learning from functional paradigm in Haskell or Elm to new approaches to my day-to-day work as [the GoTTH stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k00jVJeZxrs).

## How I started programming

During Covid-19 quarantines in France, I found myself unemployed and started to learn and play in C. A pleasure for my mind, and a very well designed language in terms of simplicity. Next year, I joined OpenClassroom formation as a trainee working at [Medhop](https://www.medhop.fr/) on their product, Orgo, for hospitals. This was the beginning of my professionnal career as a software developer. I enjoyed learning every days, mind challenges and occasionnal adrenaline shots, and still do I.

Part of them are deployed through Github Pages or Netlify, the others depend on servers and databases and must be installed before lauching them with Docker Compose.
